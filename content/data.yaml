blurb: |
  Baltimore Food Hub is a facility that manages the aggregation, storage, processing,
  distribution or marketing of locally and regionally produced food. It may include one
  or all of these functions, depending on what our tenants need. After all, this is an
  opportunity for Baltimore and we do what our people need us to do.
about: |
  _Baking more than just brownies._

  If you haven’t heard, we are growing the food innovation economy and lucky for us, we aren’t doing this alone.

  The Baltimore Food Hub is a space for all food businesses, organizations and entrepreneurs to collaborate,
  think big, and while doing so, prep, make, store and park.

  A food campus collectively lets us grow as an united front and together promote our local and regional efforts.
  Join us, as we build recognition for Baltimore’s strongest food players within the urban core.
