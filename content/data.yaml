  Baltimore Food Hub Groundbreaking!

American Communities Trust (ACT) is pleased to announce the long-awaited groundbreaking on the Baltimore Food Hub campus in East Baltimore. 

Please join us to celebrate on September 20, 2016 from noon to 1 p.m. at 1801 E. Oliver Street Baltimore, MD 21213.

Once completed, the 3.5 acre campus will include teaching and commercial production kitchens, spaces for food manufacturing, job training, urban farming, and an all-season fresh food market. 

Thanks to two years of capacity building in East Baltimore by ACT’s partner Humanim, the project is on track to create dozens of jobs, bring new life to a disinvested urban area, and provide substantial opportunities for microenterprise, workforce development, and community education.
