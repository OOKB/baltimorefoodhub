_Baking more than just brownies._

If you haven’t heard, we are growing the food innovation economy and lucky for us, we aren’t doing this alone.

The Baltimore Food Hub is a space for all food businesses, organizations and entrepreneurs to collaborate,
think big, and while doing so, prep, make, store and park.

A food campus collectively lets us grow as an united front and together promote our local and regional efforts.
Join us, as we build recognition for Baltimore’s strongest food players within the urban core.
