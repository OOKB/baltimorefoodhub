  Baltimore Food Hub is a facility where locally and regionally-produced food is  aggregated, stored, processed, distributed or marketed. It may include one or all of these functions, depending on what our tenants need. After all, this is an opportunity for Baltimore, and we do what our people need us to do.

_Baking more than just brownies._

If you haven’t heard, we are growing the food innovation economy. Lucky for us, we aren’t doing this alone.

The Baltimore Food Hub is a space for all food businesses, organizations and entrepreneurs to collaborate and think big while they  prep, make, store and park. 

A food campus lets us grow as an united front and together promote our local and regional efforts. Join us as we build recognition for what Baltimore is bringing to the table.
